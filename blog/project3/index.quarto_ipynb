        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",

        "- **`treatment`**, **`control`**: Binary indicators denoting experimental group assignment. A value of `1` in `treatment` indicates the subject received the treatment condition, while `1` in `control` indicates assignment to the control group. These two variables are mutually exclusive.\n",
        "- **`ratio`**, **`ratio2`**, **`ratio3`**: Variables reflecting matching incentives (e.g., 1:1, 2:1 matches) provided during the intervention. These are likely categorical or indicator variables showing the ratio level applied.\n",
        "- **`size`**, **`size25`**, **`size50`**, **`size100`**, **`sizeno`**: Donation ask size variables. The `size` column includes textual representations of the suggested donation amount (e.g., `\"$100,000\"`), while the other columns serve as binary indicators for specific size categories.\n",

        "- **`page18_39`**: Proportion of the population between ages 18 and 39.\n",
