    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\nTo assess whether the random assignment mechanism was successful, I conduct balance tests on three baseline variables that are not influenced by treatment:\n\nmrm2: months since last donation\n\npwhite: proportion of white residents in the donor’s area\n\nave_hh_sz: average household size\n\nFor each variable, I apply both a manual t-test and a linear regression to compare treatment and control groups. These methods should yield consistent results, since both estimate the same underlying difference in means.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Function to compute manual t-test and regression for a given variable\ndef balance_test(df, variable, treatment_col=\"treatment\"):\n    df_clean = df.dropna(subset=[variable, treatment_col])\n    treat = df_clean[df_clean[treatment_col] == 1][variable]\n    control = df_clean[df_clean[treatment_col] == 0][variable]\n\n    # Manual t-test\n    mean_treat = treat.mean()\n    mean_control = control.mean()\n    var_treat = treat.var(ddof=1)\n    var_control = control.var(ddof=1)\n    n_treat = len(treat)\n    n_control = len(control)\n    se = np.sqrt(var_treat/n_treat + var_control/n_control)\n    t_stat = (mean_treat - mean_control) / se\n\n    # Welch's degrees of freedom\n    df_num = (var_treat/n_treat + var_control/n_control)**2\n    df_denom = ((var_treat/n_treat)**2 / (n_treat - 1)) + ((var_control/n_control)**2 / (n_control - 1))\n    df_eff = df_num / df_denom\n\n    print(f\"\\n=== Balance Test: {variable} ===\")\n    print(f\"Manual t-test: t = {t_stat:.4f}, df ≈ {df_eff:.2f}\")\n\n    # Linear regression\n    formula = f\"{variable} ~ {treatment_col}\"\n    model = smf.ols(formula, data=df_clean).fit()\n    coef = model.params[treatment_col]\n    pval = model.pvalues[treatment_col]\n    print(f\"Regression coefficient on treatment: {coef:.4f}, p = {pval:.4f}\")\n    return model.summary()\n\nbalance_test(df_k, \"mrm2\")\nbalance_test(df_k, \"pwhite\")\nbalance_test(df_k, \"ave_hh_sz\")\n\n\n=== Balance Test: mrm2 ===\nManual t-test: t = 0.1195, df ≈ 33394.48\nRegression coefficient on treatment: 0.0137, p = 0.9049\n\n=== Balance Test: pwhite ===\nManual t-test: t = -0.5590, df ≈ 31876.22\nRegression coefficient on treatment: -0.0009, p = 0.5753\n\n=== Balance Test: ave_hh_sz ===\nManual t-test: t = 0.8234, df ≈ 31960.02\nRegression coefficient on treatment: 0.0030, p = 0.4098\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

This supports the integrity of the randomization process and aligns with Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), which was included in the original paper for the same purpose.\nBy demonstrating that key baseline characteristics are similar across groups, we can be more confident that any observed differences in outcome variables can be attributed to the treatment itself rather than to underlying differences in the populations.\nThe balance tests confirm that random assignment was successfully implemented in the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars.

Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.)

This suggests that framing a donation opportunity with a matching offer leads to an increased likelihood that someone contributes, even if the match amount or ratio isn’t overwhelming.\nIn other words, people are more responsive to the idea that their donation will be matched, likely because it enhances their perceived impact or makes the opportunity feel more urgent or meaningful.\n\n\n\nThese results align closely with the findings reported in Table 2A, Panel A of Karlan and List (2007):\n\nReported control group response rate: 1.8%\n\nReported treatment group response rate: 2.2%\n\nDifference: 0.004 / 0.4 percentage points\n\nThis nearly matches the 0.0042 effect size estimated in my regression. This agreement supports the accuracy of my replication and reinforces the study’s conclusion: matching offers boost donation behavior in a statistically and behaviorally significant way.\n\nSmall psychological nudges, like a match, can meaningfully shift real world decisions, even when the actual financial difference is minor.\n\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\n\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\n\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot.\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\n\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\n\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"

They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\nTo assess whether the random assignment mechanism was successful, I conduct balance tests on three baseline variables that are not influenced by treatment:\n\nmrm2: months since last donation\n\npwhite: proportion of white residents in the donor’s area\n\nave_hh_sz: average household size\n\nFor each variable, I apply both a manual t-test and a linear regression to compare treatment and control groups. These methods should yield consistent results, since both estimate the same underlying difference in means.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Function to compute manual t-test and regression for a given variable\ndef balance_test(df, variable, treatment_col=\"treatment\"):\n    df_clean = df.dropna(subset=[variable, treatment_col])\n    treat = df_clean[df_clean[treatment_col] == 1][variable]\n    control = df_clean[df_clean[treatment_col] == 0][variable]\n\n    # Manual t-test\n    mean_treat = treat.mean()\n    mean_control = control.mean()\n    var_treat = treat.var(ddof=1)\n    var_control = control.var(ddof=1)\n    n_treat = len(treat)\n    n_control = len(control)\n    se = np.sqrt(var_treat/n_treat + var_control/n_control)\n    t_stat = (mean_treat - mean_control) / se\n\n    # Welch's degrees of freedom\n    df_num = (var_treat/n_treat + var_control/n_control)**2\n    df_denom = ((var_treat/n_treat)**2 / (n_treat - 1)) + ((var_control/n_control)**2 / (n_control - 1))\n    df_eff = df_num / df_denom\n\n    print(f\"\\n=== Balance Test: {variable} ===\")\n    print(f\"Manual t-test: t = {t_stat:.4f}, df ≈ {df_eff:.2f}\")\n\n    # Linear regression\n    formula = f\"{variable} ~ {treatment_col}\"\n    model = smf.ols(formula, data=df_clean).fit()\n    coef = model.params[treatment_col]\n    pval = model.pvalues[treatment_col]\n    print(f\"Regression coefficient on treatment: {coef:.4f}, p = {pval:.4f}\")\n    return model.summary()\n\nbalance_test(df_k, \"mrm2\")\nbalance_test(df_k, \"pwhite\")\nbalance_test(df_k, \"ave_hh_sz\")\n\n\n=== Balance Test: mrm2 ===\nManual t-test: t = 0.1195, df ≈ 33394.48\nRegression coefficient on treatment: 0.0137, p = 0.9049\n\n=== Balance Test: pwhite ===\nManual t-test: t = -0.5590, df ≈ 31876.22\nRegression coefficient on treatment: -0.0009, p = 0.5753\n\n=== Balance Test: ave_hh_sz ===\nManual t-test: t = 0.8234, df ≈ 31960.02\nRegression coefficient on treatment: 0.0030, p = 0.4098\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

This suggests that framing a donation opportunity with a matching offer leads to an increased likelihood that someone contributes, even if the match amount or ratio isn’t overwhelming.\nIn other words, people are more responsive to the idea that their donation will be matched, likely because it enhances their perceived impact or makes the opportunity feel more urgent or meaningful.\n\n\n\nThese results align closely with the findings reported in Table 2A, Panel A of Karlan and List (2007):\n\nReported control group response rate: 1.8%\n\nReported treatment group response rate: 2.2%\n\nDifference: 0.004 / 0.4 percentage points\n\nThis nearly matches the 0.0042 effect size estimated in my regression. This agreement supports the accuracy of my replication and reinforces the study’s conclusion: matching offers boost donation behavior in a statistically and behaviorally significant way.\n\nSmall psychological nudges, like a match, can meaningfully shift real world decisions, even when the actual financial difference is minor.\n\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\n\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\n\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\n\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"
